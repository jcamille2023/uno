# tictactoe
An online version of Tic Tac Toe that takes advantage of Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database to provide a smooth experience for avid Tic Tac Toe players. Completed on December 3rd, the 81-day project is mostly coded in JavaScript, using 3 different script files in order to differentiate between two users in one game.
